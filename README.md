# Studio 5
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Posts will include details around researching machine learning and 
the general behaviours of a typical robot. This will include:

- Eye tracking applications
- Track-motor interaction
- Investigating the application use of Hydraulic mechanisms
- Researching around the robot's open source documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Posts will relate heavily with the construction of the robot, specifically dubbed
"Johnny 5" from the movie Short Circuit. This will include but is not limited to:

- Construction of 3-D designed parts
- Operating the mechanics of the head and neck
- Reinforcing the overall structure with certain metal elements (have not yet determined what yet)
- Operation of the lower body and tracks
- Scaling each model to an appropriate size
- Determining how each key structurual piece will interact with each other
