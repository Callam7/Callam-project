Due to the extensive work on the Orokanui prototypes, I was unable to attend volunteering during the previous weeks.
 However, I managed to attend during the two week break on the 4th and the 11th of October in which I managed to get in touch with
  Kristen about some changes she wishes to make around the volunteering program. 
  
For starters, on my first visit during the break I was able to help a couple with setting them up with two phone apps that AgeConcern has helped with 
setting up. The first being the SuperGold app, in which those in the elderly community who have a SuperGold card can look up which stores/businesses have 
established SuperGold deals, for example, 10% off at cafes or restaurants. Unfortunatly, I could only set it up for the wife as the husband did not have a gmail
 account set up on his phone. Kristen has said to me that quite often when I go into volunteering she would like a hand with setting this app up for AgeConern members, 
 as this will aid in modernizing the community's services.

The other app that the elderly couple wished to have access to was the LinkAge app, which unfortunatly could not be set up on their Apple iPad due to some regulations issue.
 However, I managed to show them how to use and access it on their phones which is very similar to the SuperGold app but displays to the user local services for the elderly. The other attendee that
  I had to help wanted to change from an old Samsung phone to a new iPhone 6. However, as her iPhone was straight out of the box, I did not want to damage it when attempting to place her SD card with her data and
   contacts on it into the iPhone. Therefore, I said that she could take it to a store (either somewhere like Noel Leeming or the Spark store) to have them insert her SD card and once done I would be able to help her with
    the rest of the set up the following week.

Unfortunatly, when I showed up on the 11th there didnt seem to be much attending and could not find the attendee who wanted help with her iPhone. This may have been due to the terrible weather as I have
 noticed that barly anyone attends during poor weather conditions.
