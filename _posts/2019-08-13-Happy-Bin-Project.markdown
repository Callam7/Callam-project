We were approached by the Polytechnic design school to create sensors that we have dubbed as the "Happy Bin Project".
The key idea of the project is to create sensors that will have a light cycle that will activate and stereo speakers that will produce a sound
once the motion sensor detects trash being dropped in. For now, I am drafting out a general sketch idea for the light cycle/RGB lights shown below:

I then set up the general idea of what the circuit board would possibly look like as a final product using a single RGB light, jumper wires,
 and a distance sensor for the motion sensing to work.

Once I could confirm that the board functioned roughly to the scope of our project, I then looked up some code to adjust the
 color changing section of the program. This prooved to be more effective than the dummy code that I had produced.

I will continue to work on the project until it meets the needs of our scope.
