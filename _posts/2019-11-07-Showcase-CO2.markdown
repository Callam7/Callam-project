We have located headers and power supplies for the CO2 sensor project, and have 
proceeded to begin soldering the circuit boards so that they are prepared for use once we have found more adafeather microchips.

I have also managed to solder up two C02 sensors for the showcase and have 3D printed out another case for one of the devices.

Unfortunately, due to the functionality of the C02 sensors detected 
temperature changes within a given environment, we have found that one of the sensors has been fried by the hot glue gun and have been reduced to only three sensors.

I will be building the third sensor in a free time period but until then we have finished up the C02 sensors and can therefore allow myself to assist with any Orokanui objectives or documentation.
