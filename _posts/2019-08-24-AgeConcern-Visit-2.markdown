Today's visit to the AgeConcern centre was an uneventful one as we only really dealt with one new visitor, 
while the others were people we had helped in our previous visit. The first visitor we helped was an elderly woman
 of which was Dutch so that created a bit of a language barrier between us. She wished to prevent her iPad from displaying 
 a red tick notification on her email icon, as well as move around some emails she would like to have saved. I informed her that
  the email icon with the red ticks was a natural default setting that the Apple product had already pre-set, as it indicated her that there
   was unread email messages. However, although we tried to explain this to her, we found this difficult as she had impaired hearing thus communication 
   was very hard to accomplish. Eventually, I managed to show her that she could save important images or files from her email to the notes application so that
    she would not lose track of them in future; seeing as many of her emails dated back to 2009 and were marked unread.

Our second visitor we aided was someone who wished to use the AgeConcern application that was advertised on the centre's notice board. However, we found that
 as the phone was outdated he could not install the desired app and would need to upgrade his phone in order to use it in future.

As a follow up, I had a chat with Kristen about the possibility of improving the way she advertises the IT support sessions, as I have noticed that there is 
usually a lack of people who attend the sessions or rather misinterpret what times the sessions actually start. I hope that she will find a solution to this soon
 as I wish to continue these sessions on a regular basis.
