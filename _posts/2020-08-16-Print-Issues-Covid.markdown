The process of 3D printing prototype parts has been a significant challenge, as the Dremel printer has been
 jamming up the PLA part way through the printing process. I have been trying to fix the printer, but as I am unfamiliar with
  the hardware I cannot in good conscience attempt it without risking any further damage to it. This has put me behind significantly on my
   written up schedule for the semester, as by this point I am supposed to have a printed head with aesthetics attached to it.
   
In the meantime while I am waiting on the printer to be fixed, I will be finalising the first OpenCV prototype to see if the infrared 
sensor will light up an LED as it follows the white area of the eye. I aim to have all 
milestones that I have set completed by the end of the month. This means that I should have the eye tracking application complete, 
aesthetics for the head done, face mask and plate printed, and the head should be able to rotate on a 
mounted motor. 

I have set this as the minimum requirement for myself, as due to the Covid-19 lockdown as well as hardware issues, I have been set 
back on my schedule. I have decided to not continue with any other work until these milestones are complete, as adding on anything new at this point would be insafficient. The 
raspberry pi macheine learning and controller applications will remain as a work in progress as there is 
a lot to research and put into practise.

I can, however, confirm that the object tracking function is working but with some slight defects. If a color other than the one set for the object appears in frame, 
then the camera will instead focus on that target rather than the primary one. This will need to be debugged in order for this to be a potential applicant for the
driving mechanism of the robot.
