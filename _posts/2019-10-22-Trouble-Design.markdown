I had recently discovered from Henry that Neville is still using the room Temperature sensor web app, so therefore I needed to start putting 
the temperature sensors back together using parts that we are not using (i.e. adafruit/feather boards, solder circuit boards, power supplies, etc). 
We also have managed to improve some of the antenna's that were poorly attached to the adafruit boards. 


Once done, I began working on soldering the improved CO2 sensors seeing as the boards needed have arrived. Unfortunately due to the strange size of the CO2 sensors, 
we cannot solder them to the circuit boards in favour of a more secure sensor case. Hence forth, I will focus on designing and prototyping the 3-D cases for the sensors of which will sadly have to remain lose.
