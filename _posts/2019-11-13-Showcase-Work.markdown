Today, I have been tasked with editing the C02 sketches via removing any known keys we have used from the internet of things network. 
This is due to the fact that all of our content allows public access, which we cannot allow as someone could easily spam the things network
 and will most likely overwhelm the database.
 
 Secondly, I will be putting together a quick pamphlet displaying a small summery of the C02 sensors, which details response time and power needed
  for it to run.
