For my task, I have been assigned to create a Gauge chart that displays the payload output of
 a given c02 device. This information would then be pulled from our database framework, of which I would rely on
  the information being produced within the TTN applications page. Once this task has been eventually completed, it 
  will then be deployed onto the iotsensors web application along side the displayed devices.
  
The challenge I will have to face is that I am not familiar with the google api structure or common php 
 page design. For this, I will have to teach myself how to overcome this disadvantage in order to produce a product that
 is up to industry standard. Furthermore, this task should be made easier to update its workload as our GitLab repositories
  have been successfully migrated.
