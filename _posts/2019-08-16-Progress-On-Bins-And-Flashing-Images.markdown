Since the first draft of the Happy Bin sensor, I have reworked the basic Arduino board so that the
 wiring will be a bit more tidy and compact for use.

Further more, I have found that the speakers seemed a bit too quiet for use so have set up with a
 louder speaker as well as updated the code to allow the motion sensor to be a bit more responsive.
  As of now, we have two working sensors with adjusted code that functions within the project's scope,
  thus this will allow me to move on to work on other projects.

Now that I have completed the Happy Bin code, as well as two sensors ready to deploy, I decided to assist with flashing 
 images to our new loRa physical sensors that will be used to detect and send data to the loRa server from a certain range.
  This will contribute to the Orokanui project as well as be also used for the Things Network.
