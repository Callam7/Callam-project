Today was mainly a task of ensut=ring all temperature devices were still sending out a signal to the database. 
This is mainly due to them being left since March during lockdown, so I was testing to make sure that the devices' hardware had not
decayed.

Sadly, I was unable to locate nigel as it had gone missing with only the case remaining in its
designated area. Once I had the devices plugged into a power source, seeing as they do not have charging
circuits in them, I was able to determine that they still send out data to the database without fail.

OInce this was established, I later on tested some of the left over Adafeather 32u4 devices to see if I could find
any with a charging circuit. I located only two but this would be efficient enough to ensure that all batteries are
charged so that the devices can be used in their assigned rooms. After fully charging two of the devices,
I tested Jack and Peter for a good 3 hours to determine that they would send out data without fail.
