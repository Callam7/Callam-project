I have found that the CO2 sensor is far more responsive and 
more stable after the soldering stage from last session. The data tends to produce more of a trend 
and increases when there are more people present. I have decided to produce the data into 
the loRa server to confirm these findings to be true. If so, I will be able to start producing 
more sensors for the coming week. Furthermore, I will be using a different arduino known as 
Adafeather so I can feed the data to the loRa server.

I am using this information as a basis on what readings I should be getting within a given space 
(i.e. outdoors, confined space, etc).
