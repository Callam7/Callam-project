During this visit, I had assisted with two attendees tech problems today. 

The first attendee wished to learn how to navigate around his photo gallery on his samsung, of which I did with ease and also aided him
 in learning how to organize and delete certain albums. 
 
The second attendee wanted assistence with finding her missed phone calls on her cellphone. However, this was vastly difficult as the phone module was extremly dated and proved to be
 a challenge to simply navigate it. 
 
My final visit for the semester will be next week.
