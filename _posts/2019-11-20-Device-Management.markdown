I have been monitoring the behaviour of our applications, devices and gateways via checking the data and hardware to ensure 
that they are all in working condition for the showcase. I have also gone through documentation for each to ensure that we are up to date 
with our setup process. This way, when we do the "hand over" period, others will be able to easily access and use our equipment with ease. However, so far the 
Nigel room temperature sensor is not quite connecting to the network within its set timeframe and C02_03 is not giving out consistent data readings.

After doing some power readings on the Nigel room temperature sensor, I have found that it is simply not sending data to the roof antenna which 
may mean that the signal is too weak for that room sensor. But after checking the antenna attached to the sensor, I have now successfully connected the Nigel sensor to the things 
network but will continue to monitor its behaviour just in case of any possible inconsistencies.

The C02_03 sensor in the project room is now sending more consistent readings, therefore I will only need to view over our 
web application for Orokanui and test the remaining prototype. The C02_01 sensor, however, is not connecting.
