While looking through the CAD models provided by the input inc design compony, I have discovered that some of the CAd files are incomplete. Furthermore, due to the unfortunate Covid-19 outbreak, there is no 
possible way for me to obtain the documented hardware needed for a working Johnny 5 model. Therefore, I have decided that 
the best course of action is to scale down the model and simply 3-D print a shell model to hold various devices and hardware. 
This way, this should minimize the hardware requirement and allows me to save time on researching for the software while 3-D models 
are being printed. Fortunatly, the input inc compont has supplied some 3-D files in STL format to start off with, of which I will investigate whether they can 
be scaled down or not.

In the mean time, I have been working on a schedule to keep up to date with so I am able to at least have a shell model and some motors working by a certain timeframe, below is the drafted schedule that I have drawn up
 to stay on top of:

As you can see, Weeks 1-2 will focus on building the head structure and working through the CAD files to determine what is actually possible to 
reproduce in this set time frame. The head model I have found within the input inc files is a master shell that does not require printing separate
parts for. This seems like a good place to start and get an idea on where the main controller for the whole robot should be sitting.

The schedule is well planned, however, I have made a small note to myself that this is not set in stone, as past experiences have proven that
 anything that can go wrong eventually will, so I am approaching this with a small level of skepticism.
