This post exists just to differentiate between semesters. 
It is also due to the gitlab services being down for a while, ergo I could not commit anything until now.

I have choosen to begin working on a humidity sensor for the Dunedin Icerink by recycling the current room sensors we
 have in storage. Furthermore, I will be working on a web-based app for the C02 sensors so the user can read the current 
C02 levels within an given environment on the web app.
