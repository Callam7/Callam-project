I have recently soldered the wiring within the gate sensor. This is so the wiring can be a bit more secure during its use at the Orokanui Ecosantuary.

On an unrelated note, I will be charging the small battery power supplies needed for the temperature sensors as their charge time is insufficient. Furthermore, 
I will use the CO2 devices as a means of charging them while also fine tuning any irregular data. In the meantime, I will also be helping Kevin with power cycling his polykids 
sensor project. So far could only locate at least two battery supplies, both of which are being charged as we speak.
