I choose to work with the IOT/Sensors project team as I had thoroughly enjoyed doing Embedded Systems last semester, of which peaked
 my interest in the subject of working with the Arduino boards. Furthermore, it incourages the use of a creative mindset meaning that there will be a great degree of flexability
 when working with sensors/Arduino, something I quite like in terms of technology.

Today my goal was to establish communications between my co-workers and a working schedule in order to shape my work load around each individual's needs. 
 As we have not visited the Orokanui Ecosantury site yet, I spent today mainly gaining a general idea on what it is our scope includes, as well as the general work load of the project. 
 As a means to accomplish something, I decided to do a bit of testing on the Arduino equipment and data sensors to ensure that they are still receiving/sending data. 
 This was also to "get my feet wet" as I would be using this type of equipment very frequently throughout the project. Essentially, my main task that was done was to install the dependencies we would be using on all devices (i.e. Sleep dog, ABP, etc.) this way I will be all set up for any future task around using this equipment.
