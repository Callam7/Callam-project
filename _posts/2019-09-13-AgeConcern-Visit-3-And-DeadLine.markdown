The visit today was a bit lacklustre at best, as I was only able to help a single attendee with his phone 
 due to a lack of people for todayâ€™s visit. The attendee wished to know how to use his camera on his phone, which was simple enough, 
 but I also took it upon myself to show him how to navigate his gallery and the basic camera features so he would have that little extra knowledge if needed.
 After my routine visit, I went back to the project room to continue on my sensors. As of now, the CO2 sensors are ready to start being mass produced as the code and 
 the wire layout is perfectly fine. The only things that are missing is to apply the sleep agent to each sensor and to supply a power source that will 
 match the voltage required to run the CO2 sensors. After measuring the CO2 sensor voltage I have determined that I need to research a 
 way to set up the sleep dog agent so that it will cut off power to the sensor if it reaches a certain point after a minute of stabilizing. 


However, I am stepping back from this at the moment as there is a very strict deadline for the Orokanui project, 
therefore I have taken it upon myself to produce at least two more prototypes for the gates, of which I will focus on the chain-link 
fence and the lift-up latch. I hope to get these done by the Wednesday evening coming up, as I have managed my schedule to fit in this task specifically.
