With the current situation taking place involving the Covid-19 pandemic, we are now tasked to work remotely from
 our home stations. This, however, has created a large predicament for myself as I am currently struggling with balancing Polytechnic workload
  with that of my current job shifts as I am an essentail worker. 
  
Be it as it may, I have made small but relative progress with the Gauge chart task as I have been working on setting up the basic layout and design of
 the chart based upon the retrieved example.
 
 <img src= "{{site.baseurl}}/assets/Images/basicGauge.PNG" alt = "c02Chart">
 
I have managed to modify the code so that the display will look as such:

 <img src= "{{site.baseurl}}/assets/Images/editedGauge.PNG" alt = "gaugeChange">


However, I have had large issues reguarding that of pulling data from the database as navigating php format has proven to be quite the obstacle. 
 I have been using the c02 graph that was displayed at our previous showcase as a skeleton tool to format my code, but as I am trying to display only one value
  on a different chart format, it has been challenging to say the least for me to get this task functioning. 
  
Although difficult, I have been resilient in my research on how to pull and display data from a database as I have come to learn that it is required for 
me to utilize objects refered to as ajax and json. So for the next few days, I will be teaching myself how to use ajax and json in order to display live data within my chart
 as I fermly believe it will improve my chances on completing my given task.
