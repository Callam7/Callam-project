I have been working on ensuring that all temperature sensors are still sending out data to the database. As we were unable to keep the devices charged
during lockdown, all temperature devices had been offline due to power depletion. Therefore, I went out and gathered all devices to prepare them for
charging. At the moment, I have set up robert to be on charge and can now send through data.

I have yet to prepare the other devices for charging, but it has been discussed that we should establish a more permanent solution rather than consistently 
going back and forth to charge devices.

In the meantime, I have completed documentation for the gauge chart project and is currently being tested. Once done, I will
work with my team members to prepare the files for deployment and add in instructions on how to deploy. In addition, I have managed to add in
small instrcutions on how to properly test the chart to ensure its functionality is working correctly. This includes steps on how to use both
putty and winSCP to interact with our kate account.

I will then need to find another task to help finish and deploy now that my tasks are pretty much complete.
