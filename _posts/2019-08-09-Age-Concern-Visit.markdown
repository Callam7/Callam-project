Today I went out to do some volunteering service at the Age Concern centre located in the Octogen. Now, this was mainly to see what 
it was like and to determine if I would be up to doing repeated visits every week.


Although it was quiet, I helped with some basics. For instance, my first attendee required some knowledge on how to use their camera phone. 
This proved simple, however, I also offered further assistance with showing her how to download/install apps in a 
quick and easy fashion. I only showed the steps needed as I did not wish to accidently put her phone at risk, in case an app locked her phone or stole information.


My second attendee needed some advice around their Microsoft copy. Based on what she had explained to me, I told her that 
the problem would be that even if they could recover the product key, it would be a version that is no longer supported, or the key had expired. 


My final attendee needed help with figuring out how to access his emails and to turn off his laptop. However, I soon found that 
his email (used through Gmail) would not load or process anything and would even freeze just by simply clicking on the search bar. However, the big red flag was 
when it was meant to update and shutdown, but just shut down without the kernel going or a chance to log out. I suggested that he should take it back to the 
supplier and see if they can offer further assistance. 


During this time, I maintained a professional behaviour around the elderly attendees, and as such I wouldn't mind doing this again if my schedule aloud it.
