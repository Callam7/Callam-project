I am pleased to see that due to the rework of the CO2 sensor code, we are now getting far more accurate readings.

I have begun designing on a stable case for the CO2 sensors through the SketchUp web app, as we have previously discussed about bread boarding/soldering 
the devices down rather than having lose wiring and sensors shaking about inside a lose case. It is preferred that we have a stable device rather than a finished 
product with a slew of flaws. We will need to focus on just getting the two that have been deployed reworked so we can display them for the upcoming showcase, whereas 
the rest will be reworked on a more 'passive' rate.

Furthermore, I have noticed that there is a need for us to organise the internet of things 
folder hierarchy as well as general documentation of all devices, code, web apps, etc. This is due to the fact that within our nodes 
folder there are at least three or four folders for the same device so I have decided that while we are waiting for more circuit bread boards and measurements for 
3-D printing, I will look at reorganizing the folders so that there should only be one folder for each type of device within the nodes branch.
