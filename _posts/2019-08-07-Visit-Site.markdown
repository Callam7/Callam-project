Today we went out to explore the gates that we would be working with at the Orokanui Ecosanctuary. It was established that we were to meet at 9am to 
depart then leave at 1130am from the site, this way we would not exclude other classes from our schedule. Our main goal with the visit was to attach 
the Antenna to an elevated position, then splice the wiring so we could feed it through a space in the walls. 

Before we could do that, we spent the first half hour looking at the various gates that we would create sensors for. Our first gate operates currently 
with a chained lock, which would make this one a bit complex to work around, however we did discuss the possibility of using some form of a magnet 
to detect when the latch is used by someone.

The second gate we came across along the track was a bit more complex however, as it operates on a spring-loaded lock and is 
very loose. Creating a sensor that takes these variables into account may prove difficult in the long term.

As we were short on time, we made the next stop our last one for the time being. This gate would be the easier one to work with, 
as it already has a simple latch which allows us to create a simplistic sensor that detects when the latch is raised.

Once our trek was done, I assisted on splicing the Antenna's wire, while the other team members worked on feeding the wiring through the wall.

Below is the step by step process on the wire feeding and set up of the Antenna:

After a while and a bit of trial and error, we were successful with the set up. However, it was decided that during our next visit 
we would readjust the wiring as it was "brute forced" which is certainly not ideal.

Finally, to conclude a good dayâ€™s work, we saw data being received on the loRa server from Orokanui making our test set up a success.
