The main objective today  was to decide on an idea to work on for Studio 5 and Project 2 respectivly.

I have decided on building a functioning replica of the Johnny 5 Robot from the 1980s movie, Short Circuit, of which
the general concept will be that it will operate via the use of machine learning software controlled through one device
 that can communicate with other devices and motors throughout the body. Overall, I wish for this robot to function and move around
 with no assistance whatsoever, meaning that it will be completely self-driven.
Below is a concept design of what I would roughly like to implement.

Furthermore, I have made a compromise on Studio 5 and Project 2. Studio 5 will be for me to research and implement the
software that is required to run Johnny 5 (i.e. a One-To-Many relationship between devices), of which will require heavy documentation
so future applicants are able to apply the required set up to the build correctly. Whereas Project 2 will be for simply
building the Johnny 5 robot, such as design, hardware, etc.

Based on what I want the robot to functionly do, I will need to research the following in order to gain a 
general understanding of what I may need to properly have a machine learning
Johnny 5 robot:
		-Raspberry pi controller
		-Face tracking technology
		-eye tracking
		-Open CV
		-Color Tracking
		-Glyph Recogntion
		-Objecy Tracking
		-SD card manipulation
		-3D Printing 
		-CAD model modification

If all goes well, the final product should look similar to this:
